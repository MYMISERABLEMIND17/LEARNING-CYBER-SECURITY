NETWORKING 

WHY  NETWORKING ?
	>  FOUNDATION OF ALL THE ATTACKS AND DEFENSE 
	> NETWORK VISIBILITY 
	> EFFECTIVE INCIDENT RESPONSE 
	> REAL WORLD EXPLOIT DEPEND ON IT 
                                                    
HISTORY
	
	>ARPANET => WORLD FIRST NETWORK , BY US MILITARY 


 TYPES OF NETWORK 
	
	> LAN => LOCAL AREA NETWORK 
	> MAN => METRO AREA NETWORK ( LIKE THROUGH CELL 	TOWER )
	>PAN => PERSONAL AREA NETWORK (OUR PERSONAL TS 	OR DEVICE )
	> WAN => WIDE AREA NETWORK (CONNECT WHOLE 	WORLD )


DATA TRANSFER TERMS 
	> LATENCY => HOW FAST THE DATA TRAVEL FROM ONE 	POINT TO ANOTHER 
	> BANDWIDTH => HOW MUCH DATA TRAVEL IN A SECOND 
	> THROUGHPUT =>ACTUAL SPEED OF THE INTERNET 
	> JITTER => MOOD SWINGS OF NETWORK OF FLUCTUATION

TOPOLOGY
	> START TOPOLOGY => 
	> BUS TOPOLOGY => 
	>RING TOPOLOGY =>
	> MESH NETWORK TOPOLOGY=> 


HOW INTERNET WORKS 
	> CLIENT-SERVER CONNECTION
	> PEER-TO-PEER CONNECTION (P2P)

OSI MODEL 
	> APPLICATION LAYER 
	> PRESENTATION LAYER 
	> SESSION LAYER 
	> TRANSPORT LAYER
	> NETWORK LAYER 
	> DATA LINK LAYER  
	> PHYSICAL LAYER 

 ENCAPSULATION => THIS IS A PROCESS , IN WHICH HEADER IS ADDED TO THAT DATA 

DECAPSULATION => IN WHICH WE TAKE OUT THAT HEAD FROM THE DATA  
	
TYPE OF CABLE 
	>COPPER
	>FIBER
	>COAXIAL (AUX Cable )


TRANSCEIVERS 
	>RJ45 /RJ 11 ( ETHERNET KA SOCKET )
	>SFP/SFP+ (USED IN BOTH TELECOMMUNICATION AND 	ETHERNET )
	> QSFP

LINK SPEEDS AND PoE 
	> PoE = POWER OF ETHERNET
	> LINK SPEED 

CABLING STANDARDS 
	>CAT  5 
	>CAT 5E
	>CAT 6


ETHERNET FRAME AND MAC  ADDRESSES
	> destionation mac 
	>source mac
	> payload => data in other words 
	>crc => errors 
	
SWITCHING LOGIC – SMART TRAFFIC CONTROL 
	>CAM TABLE => it is like a phone book consider different things 
	>LEARNING => kind of function , assign i/p to port or mac and all
	>FLOODING=> if any mac address try  to take random permission , 	then it shows the errors
                                          
SPANNING TREE PROTOCOL (STP)
	>it works like a police in network world 


IP ADDRESSING AND SUBNETTING 
	> IPv4 
	> IPv6

TYPES OF IP 
	> PRIVATE IP => THE ADDRESS THAT THE ROUTER GAVE 	TO 	ME , SO THAT I CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THE 	ROUTER 
	> PUBLIC IP => SO THIS IS THE IP THAT MY ISP GIVE TO ME 	SO THAT I CAN COMMUNICATE WITH OUTSIDE WORLD I.E 	YOUTUBE, GOOGLE AND ALL .
	> DYNAMIC IP => SO THE IP ADDRESS WHICH CAN BE 	CHANGED ,WHEN RE CONNECT TO ROUTER 
	> STATIC IP =>  IP THAT NEVER CHANGED , LIKE EVERY 	WEBSITE HAVE ITS PERMANENT IP ADDRESS
